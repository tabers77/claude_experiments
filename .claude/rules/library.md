# Library Rules

When working in this repository:

1. **Skills must be self-contained** - Each skill folder should work when copied to another project
2. **Document with examples** - Every skill needs example usage
3. **Sync with playbook** - When updating skills, check if playbook needs updates too
4. **Test in test_project** - Verify skills work before considering them complete
